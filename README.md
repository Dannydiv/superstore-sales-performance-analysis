## 📊 Superstore-Sales-Performance-Analysis
#### Retail Sales and Profitability Analysis using Excel Power Query and Power Pivot


### 📌Project Overview

This project analyzes retail sales data from 2014–2017 to evaluate sales performance, profitability drivers, and margin risks across products, customers, regions, and shipping modes.

Using Excel Power Query and Power Pivot, I built a 3-page executive dashboard designed to support data-driven decision-making for sales leaders and executives.

### 🎯 Business Problem

Despite strong sales growth, the business lacked visibility into:

Which products, customers, and regions truly drive profitability

How discounting and shipping choices impact margins

Why high sales volumes often fail to translate into high profit

### 🧩 Dataset

Source: Kaggle (Super Store dataset)

Period: 2014–2017

Granularity: One row per order line item

Key fields include:

Orders: Order ID, Order Date, Ship Mode

Customers: Customer ID, Segment

Products: Category, Sub-Category

Metrics: Sales, Quantity, Discount, Profit

### 🛠 Tools & Skills

Excel

Power Query – data cleaning & transformation

Power Pivot (DAX) – data modeling & measures

Time Intelligence

Executive dashboard design

Business insight storytelling

### 📊 Key Insights

Discounts above 15% consistently erode profitability

Furniture generates the highest sales but the lowest margin (~2.5%)

November and December drive peak sales but below-average margins

Home Office customers deliver the highest profit margins

Second Class shipping sells the most but yields the lowest margins

### 📈 Recommendations

#### 🔸 Cap discounts at 15% to protect margins

#### 🔸 Optimize pricing and cost structure for Furniture

#### 🔸 Shift focus from volume to margin during peak seasons

#### 🔸 Promote high-margin customer segments

#### 🔸 Review shipping cost efficiency
